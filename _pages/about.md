I currently work as a research engineer at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in Stuttgart, Germany. My research is about generalization and  robustness of deep learning models for computer vision, with a special focus on semantic segmentation. Previously I worked on quantum many-body physics and photography with applications to quantum metrology. I was a PostDoc at the TU Vienna, and obtained a Research Fellowship from Stanford University. I completed my PhD in Physics at the University of Heidelberg, Germany under supervision of Prof. Cederbaum.

For more details, see my CV and Google Scholar.
