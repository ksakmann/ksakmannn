I currently work as a research engineer at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/about-us/our-people/) in Stuttgart, Germany. I previously worked on quantum sensors as a Postdoctoral Reserch Fellow at [TU Wien](http://atomchip.org/) (2015-2016), and [Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/kasevich/cgi-bin/wordpress/) (2012-2015).
I completed my Physics PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.pci.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/index.html), Germany under supervision of Prof. Cederbaum.

My current research is on the robustness of deep learning models for computer vision, specifically outlier detection in semantic segmentation, object detection and conformal prediction. In customer projects I have worked on projects using domain adaptation, generative models and general outlier detection techniques.

For more details, please see my [CV](/files/CV-Kaspar-Sakmann.pdf) and the [publications](/publications/).
