I work as a research engineer at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/about-us/our-people/) in Stuttgart, Germany.

Previously, I was a Physics Postdoc at the TU Vienna, and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Stanford University.

I completed my Physics PhD at the University of Heidelberg, Germany under supervision of Prof. Cederbaum.


My current research topics are generalization and robustness of deep learning models for computer vision
with a special focus on semantic segmentation. In customer projects I have worked on topics such as domain adaptation,
generative models and outlier detection.


For more details, see my CV and Google Scholar.
