I work as a research engineer at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/about-us/our-people/) in Stuttgart, Germany.

Previously, I worked on quantum sensors and many-body dynamics. I was a Physics postdoc at the [TU Vienna](http://atomchip.org/) (2015-2016), and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/kasevich/cgi-bin/wordpress/) (2012-2015).  

I completed my Physics PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.pci.uni-heidelberg.de/cms/index.html), Germany under supervision of Prof. Cederbaum.


My current research topics are generalization and robustness of deep learning models for computer vision
with a special focus on outlier detection in semantic segmentation. In customer projects I have worked on topics such as domain adaptation,
generative models and outlier detection.
