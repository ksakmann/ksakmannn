The quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional bosonic Josephson junction is studied by solving
the time-dependent many-boson Schrödinger equation numerically exactly.
Already for weak interparticle interactions and on short time scales,
the commonly employed mean-field and many-body methods are found to deviate substantially from the exact dynamics.
The system exhibits rich many-body dynamics such as enhanced tunneling and a novel equilibration phenomenon
of the junction depending on the interaction, which is attributed to a quick loss of coherence.
