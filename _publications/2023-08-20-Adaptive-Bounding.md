We quantify the uncertainty in multi-object bounding
box predictions via conformal prediction. Using novel ensemble and quantile regression formulations, we are able
to achieve per-class prediction intervals with guaranteed
coverage that are adaptive to object size. We validate
our approaches on real-world datasets (COCO, Cityscapes,
BDD100k) for 2D bounding box localization, and achieve
the desired coverage targets with sensibly tight intervals.
